# Project TODO List

## Completed

- Organize project directory structure for clarity and maintainability.
- Remove all build artifacts and unused files.
- Move all API/data logic to /services and ensure no direct API calls in components.
- Centralize all constants in constants.ts and all types/interfaces in types.ts.
- Update README.md and add comments to complex logic for better documentation.
- Check if flight prediction logic checks ground altitude to ensure accurate landing results in accordance with local topology.
- Check if simulation logic checks ground altitude to ensure accurate landing results in accordance with local topology.
- Implement terrain-based landing zone analysis for mountainous regions with warnings and risk assessment.
- Add nearest car-accessible road point detection and display on the landing prediction map.
- Add comprehensive ground elevation caching to reduce API calls during prediction with cache statistics display.

## Pending

- [x] Add a field for tracking callsign in the Mission Planning interface.
    - Allow users to enter a callsign for APRS or other tracking in the mission planning form.
- [x] Ensure the prediction algorithm is calculating the correct landing time and passing it to the weather fetch logic.
    - Double-check that the landing time is accurate and used for weather queries.
- [x] Add landing terrain and nearest road markers to the interface for better visualization.
    - Show terrain analysis and nearest road access on the landing map for user reference.
- [x] Update the map UI to distinguish between nearest road and trail markers for landing site access. If a trail is found, show a hiker/walking icon for the trail and a car icon for the nearest road at the trailhead, including Google Maps links for both.
- [ ] Fix all remaining linter warnings across the codebase, including replacing 'any' with specific types, removing unused variables, and correcting React hook dependencies.
- [ ] Explicitly type all React state setter parameters (e.g., prev in setState) throughout the codebase.
- [x] Update all map components to include defensive checks for valid lat/lng before rendering markers or polylines.
- [ ] Ensure all conversions between FlightPoint and APRSPosition use the correct lon/lng mapping.
- [ ] Fix all forbidden require() usages and replace with ES imports.
- [ ] Remove or fill all empty block statements in the codebase.
- [ ] Address Fast Refresh/component export warnings in icon and component files.

## Completed Tasks âœ…

- [x] Comprehensive linter cleanup and best practices implementation
- [x] Explicit typing of all React state setter parameters
- [x] Defensive checks for valid lat/lng in map components
- [x] Fix simulation landing detection - balloons should stop generating positions when truly landed
- [x] Modify search circle to appear at 2000ft above terrain elevation, not sea level
- [x] Add landing detection based on missing beacon intervals when close to ground
- [x] Implement algorithm comparison feature against CUSF/HABHUB standards
